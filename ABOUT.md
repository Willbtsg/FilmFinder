# The original program was submitted as a group project for CS-321 on 12/5/19.

# -The program is now centered in the screen
# -A JOptionPane now appears to allow the user to enter the name of the file they would like to use (FEATURE REPLACED)
# -The search boxes now have KeyListeners so that a search can be done by hitting "Enter"
# -MainView now takes user to a dropdown menu with the files they can choose from, while DBWizard gives the user the option to create a new file instead.
# -FuzzySearch toggle in SearchView has been shifted

# FilmFinder

# The original program was submitted as a group project for CS-321 on 12/5/19.

# Updates that have been made since then include the following
# -The program is now centered in the screen
# -A JOptionPane now appears to allow the user to enter the name of the file they would like to use
# -The search boxes now have KeyListeners so that a search can be done by hitting "Enter"

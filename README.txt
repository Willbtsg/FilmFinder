# FilmFinder

# In order for FilmFinder to work, FilmFinder.jar must be in the same directory as the "images" and "data" folders.
# If want a movie you add to a database to have a picture, that picture should be stored as a .png with the same name as the movie.
# When saving movie posters as .png files, all spaces should be replaced with underscores. All punctuation aside from periods and apostrophes should also be replaced with underscores.
